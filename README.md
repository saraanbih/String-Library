# **String Library**  

Hi everyone, welcome to my **String Library** project! ðŸŽ‰  
This is a small library containing several useful functions that can be applied to strings in C++.  

---

## **Project Overview**  

The **String Library** provides a variety of functions that can help you manipulate and process strings efficiently. The library includes several pre-implemented functions that are ready to use for your string-related tasks.

You can explore the header file `String.h` to see the available functions, and the implementation details can be found in the `String.cpp` file. Iâ€™ve tried to cover all the important string operations, but if you spot something missing, feel free to contribute!

## **How to Use**  

1. **Include the Library**:  
   - To use the functions, simply include `String.h` in your C++ project.
   
2. **Explore the Functions**:  
   - Check out `String.h` to see the function declarations.
   - Review the implementations in `String.cpp` for more details on how each function works.
   
3. **Function Names**:  
   - The function names are carefully chosen to reflect their purpose, making it easy to understand and use them effectively.

## **Available Functions**  

You can find the full list of functions in the `String.h` file, but here are some examples of the kinds of functions you can expect:

- **String Reversal**
- **Substring Search**
- **String Concatenation**
- **String Length Calculation**
- **String Case Conversion (Uppercase/Lowercase)**

## **Future Enhancements**  

In future updates, I plan to:  
- Add more advanced string processing functions.
- Optimize the current functions for better performance.
- Implement functions to handle special character manipulations (e.g., escaping characters, replacing substrings).

## **Conclusion**  

Thank you for checking out the **String Library** project! I hope you find it useful for your string manipulation tasks in C++. Enjoy using it, and feel free to contribute or suggest improvements! ðŸ˜Š
